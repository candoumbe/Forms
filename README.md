# FORMS


This project aims at describing forms using HTML like syntax and objects.

The idea behind this project is to give opportunity to APIs written in .NET to describe endpoints and responses and input in a HTML like way 
so clients could **dynamically** generate inputs to push data to a given endpoints.
